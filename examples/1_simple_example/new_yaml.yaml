# dataset [str, required]: Identifier of dataset.
dataset: simulated_binary_6_gens_samplingNoise

# data_folder [str, default='']:
# Path (absolute or relative to "bonsai-development") to folder where input data can be found. This folder
# should contain a file with means and standard-deviations in files "delta.txt" and "d_delta.txt" unless filenames_data
# changes this behaviour.
data_folder: examples/1_simple_example/example_data/simulated_binary_6_gens_samplingNoise/

# filenames_data [str, default=delta.txt,d_delta.txt]:
# Filenames of input-files for means and standard deviations separated by a comma. These files
# should have different cells as columns, and features (such as log transcription quotients) as rows.
filenames_data: delta.txt,d_delta.txt

# results_folder [str, default='']:
# Path (absolute or relative to "bonsai-development") to folder where results will be stored.'
results_folder: examples/1_simple_example/results/simulated_binary_6_gens_samplingNoise/

# verbose [bool, default=true]: False only shows essential print messages
verbose: true

# input_is_sanity_output [bool, default=true]:
# The provided means and stds will usually be the means and stds of the posterior for the
# feature: P(x | D), but in Bonsai we need the likelihood of the data given the feature value: P(D | x). These are
# related through P(x | D) ~ P(D | x) P(x). So, we would need to divide out the prior. If the input is Sanity-output
# we know how to do this because the reported posterior is Gaussian and the prior was Gaussian around zero.
# If your input-data is not Sanity-output but meets the same requirement, you can provide a file prior_std.txt with
# either a single standard-deviation that was fitted for the prior, or a std per gene (on different rows, as in
# variance.txt in the example dataset).
# Another option is to already correct for the prior yourself to make sure that the provided means and stds are such
# that P(D | x) is well approximated by a product of Gaussians with given means and stds. Then set this param. to false
input_is_sanity_output: true


######################################## Running parameters ######################################################

# zscore_cutoff [float, default=1]:
# Genes with a signal-to-noise ratio under this cutoff will be dropped. Negative means: keep all.
# Due to the large number of genes dominated by noise, tree-reconstruction is usually better when we discard the most
# noisy genes, even though we account for error-bars rigorously.
# zscore is defined as: z_g = sqrt{frac{1}{C} sum_c frac{(delta_{gc} - bar{delta_g})^2}{epsilon_{gc}^2}}
# where delta_{gc} is the feature value for gene g and cell c, epsilon_{gc} is the standard-deviation
zscore_cutoff: 1.0

# rescale_by_var [bool, default=True]:
# This determines whether oordinates are rescaled by the inferred variance per gene (feature).
# This is equivalent to putting the prior assumption that it is more likely to see change in a certain gene's expression
# when the gene shows much variation over the whole dataset.
rescale_by_var: true

# nnn_n_randommoves [int, default=1000]:
# Decides how many random nearest-neighbor-interchange-moves we do before doing them greedily.
nnn_n_randommoves: 1000

# nnn_n_randomtrees [int, default=10]:
# Decides how many random trees we create before taking the tree with the highest loglikelihood and doing nnn greedily.
# Since the creation of one random tree is not parallelized, it never hurts to set nnn_n_randomtrees equal to the
# number of cores that are anyhow reserved, since then the different random trees will be created in parallel.
nnn_n_randomtrees: 2


######################################## Speed-up configurations ######################################################

# use_knn [int, default=10]:
# Decides whether nearest-neighbours are used to get candidate pairs to merge. Set to -1 for consideringall pairs of
# leafs. Values between 5 and 20 give good results. Computation time will scale approximately linear with use_knn, but
# tree likelihood may also increase slightly with this parameter.
use_knn: 5

# UB_ellipsoid_size [float, default=1.0]:
# This is a purely computational optimization that does not affect the final result.
# Decides whether we calculate an upper bound (UB) for the increase in loglikelihood that
# merging a certain pair can yield, given that a the root stays in a certain ellipsoid. Using these upper bounds, the
# calculation can be sped up enormously. If the UB_ellipsoid_size < 0, this estimation will not be used. Otherwise,
# it decides how large the ellipsoid is in root-position/precision space for which we estimate the UB. Larger values
# will result in looser UB, so that more candidate pairs per merge have to be considered. However, it will also
# result in longer validity of the UB-estimation, so that more merges can be done without re-calculating the upper
# bounds.
# Ellipsoid sizes below 5 are reasonable to try, I recommend to start at 1. Ellipsoid size will be updated dynamically
# by Bonsai based on the results.
UB_ellipsoid_size: 1.0

########################### Information on starting from previous runs configurations ###############################

# The main Bonsai calculation takes the 4 below steps. After each step, the current tree will be stored in the results-
# folder. Therefore, if Bonsai fails (or runs out of time) in some step, it can be picked up from the end-result of the
# previous step. In that case, set skip_<step> of all previous steps to true.

#  - greedy_merging: greedily merging pairs starting from the star-tree
#  - redo_starry: detecting nodes that still have more than 2 children, and checking if more merges can be done
#  - opt_times: optimizing all branch length simultaneously once
#  - nnn_reordering: taking any edge and interchanging children of the two connected nodes

# skip_greedy_merging [bool, default=false]
skip_greedy_merging: false

# skip_redo_starry [bool, default=false]
skip_redo_starry: false

# skip_opt_times [bool, default=false]
skip_opt_times: false

# skip_nnn_reordering [bool, default=false]
skip_nnn_reordering: false

# pickup_intermediate [bool, default=false]:
# Decides whether we look for intermediate results from previous runs or not. These
# intermediate results are periodically stored during any normal run, and can thus be used when a run did not finalize.

# (ADVANCED) tmp_folder [str, default='']:
# Path (absolute path or relative to "bonsai-development") pointing to a tree-folder from which
# Bonsai reconstruction will start.
# Relevant if one wants to start from a tree other than the usual star-tree, for example if one already created a
# tree-object where cellstates were connected to a common ancestor.
